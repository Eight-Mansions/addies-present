2. About Addie's Present
======================================================

Project History:

Firstly, we ask for this project to not be confused
with the translated originally started by translator
Aishsha and romhacker Esperknight to be shared by
internet hype person CJ Iwakura a few years ago,
shown here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvc3Ux3KgGE

Due to personal reasons, Aishsha had to drop the project
and return the scripts to Esperknight. Esperknight
offered the project to Cargodin, who re-translated the
entire script from scratch, so this project does not
match the footage above in any way.


Content Warnings:

This game has a loose 1930s-1950s atmosphere,
and feels all the more modest for it. 

The main characters are children, and two notable
lines are made that, depending on where you live
and how your community might interpret them,
could come off as awkward, or at worst,
slightly uncomfortable.

(Specifics: one adult muses about what could be
interpreted as flirting with a child, and later on,
a child makes a brief comment about bathing. Like,
I don't think they're a big deal at all, but I don't
want my thoughts to take anything away from anyone
else, yknow?)

I don't recall any photosensitivity issues, and
none have been reported by recent testers thus far.
Backgrounds are prerendered illustrations, and the
screen is never consistently dark or dimlit.
Still, if you have a history with photosensitivity,
I'd recommend checking out footage online or with
a friend before diving into it yourself.

The subtitles are timed to the dialogue in the game,
and are by default set to progress automatically.
If you'd like to forsake the auto-progression and
take your time when reading the dialogue, go to the
Option menu, Visual, Text and change "auto" to "step"
before starting the game.

If you find something in the game that deserves
a content warning to better help other people,
please let us know and we'll update the readme
and aim to do better by our next patch release,
whatever game that might be.

3. Patching Instructions
======================================================
 
Notes from Esper:
Just drag and drop the ISO (bin) file onto
"Drag and drop ISO on me.bat". This will
automatically patch the game for you.

======================================================
4. Patch Notes/Warnings
======================================================

Nothing so far. 
If you happen to find anything, do let us know!

======================================================
5. Puzzle Vocabulary Index (Japanese and English)
======================================================


To start, there is a Japanese Hiragana search in the
in-game Users' Manual. Unfortunately, the text can be
a bit cramped, so I simply removed the Japanese text
from each of the puzzle pages. (Even Japanese players
have complained that the kanji is too tiny to read
inside of the book, so no skin off anyone's nose, tbh.

For the two people who might want to experiment with
this, I've included a list of all Start Words and
Target Words, along with their Japanese translations.

*This list may have minor spoilers for different
puzzles, but they won't be in chronological order,
so it might be hard to guess as much. Either way,
I'd avoid looking at this until you clear the story.
